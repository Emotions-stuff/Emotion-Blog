Hey guys it has been a while and I have not streamed in a little while and I want to update you on why this has happened, First of all I have been having somputer issues as well as some IRL stuff taking over a lot, Secondly I have started some major projects, one with a friend and another to support me first project. These projects are as follows [Valkyriecoms](https://valkyriecoms.com), [Toastielab](https://toastielab.dev) and last but not least a small group stared by me and a good friend who you may know by Elearu called [Dragon's Child Studios](https://dragonschildstudios).

As you can see I have been quite busy but I hope I will be able to return to streaming once everything starts to quiet down a little.

Thanks for taking the time to read this,
Toastie_t0ast (EmotionChild)
